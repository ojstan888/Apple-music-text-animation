# Apple music text animation
### Frontend: Native JS

I wanted to to create some animation and to practise some technologies (requestAnimationFrame and etc)

### In this app
1) You can scroll to particular peace of text, click on it.
2) Text binded to playback, so you can move playback too.
3) Revealing text animation takes place in the center of the window, thus I'm using a bit of calculations.
